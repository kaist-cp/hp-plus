## Introduction

[*Hazard pointers (HP)*](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/571825.571829), a popular and one of the earliest reclamation schemes, require each thread to announce the *protection* of each object before accessing. But this alone doesn't guarantee safety, because another thread may have concurrently retired and reclaimed the same object. To ensure safety, *validation* is needed to check whether the pointer is freed or not. However, it's impossible to precisely decide, so validation often *over-approximates* the freed pointer set. HP is not applicable to many high-performance data structures that *optimistically traverse* nodes. Their traversal follows the link to the next node even when the next node might have been detached from the data structure. This is fundamentally incompatible with HPâ€™s validation by over-approximating unreachability. To use HP, the data structure must forgo *optimistic traversal*, resulting in significantly lower performance compared to structures using *optimistic traversal*.

We design **HP++, a backward-compatible extension for HP** to improve applicability by enabling optimistic traversal. The key idea is *under-approximating* the unreachability in validation to allow optimistic traversal by letting the deleter mark the node *after* detaching, and *patching up* the potentially unsafe accesses arising from false-negatives by letting the deleter protect such pointers. Thanks to optimistic traversal, data structures with HP++ outperform the same-purpose data structures with HP under contention while consuming a similar amount of memory.

## API Design

You can check the actual implementation of [Harris's list](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/netos/papers/2001-caslists.pdf) in [tests/harris_list.rs](tests/harris_list.rs).

This crate provides two major APIs: `try_protect_pp` and `try_unlink`, corresponding to **TryProtect** and **TryUnlink** in the original paper, respectively.

(`.._pp`, which stands for *plus-plus*, is used in `try_protect_pp` to distinguish with `try_protect` function that provides HP version of protecting.)

### `try_protect_pp`

```rust
pub fn try_protect_pp<T, S, F>(
    &mut self,
    ptr: *mut T,
    src: &S,
    src_link: &AtomicPtr<T>,
    check_stop: &F,
) -> Result<(), ProtectError<T>>
where
    F: Fn(&S) -> bool,
```

Traversing threads use `try_protect_pp` to protect a pointer loaded from a source object.

It takes 4 arguments (except the `HazardPointer` to protect with):

1. `ptr`: the pointer to protect.
2. `src`: the reference of the source object.
3. `src_link`: the field of `src` from which `ptr` was loaded.
4. `is_invalid`: the predicate to check whether src is invalidated.

If `src` is invalidated, `try_protect_pp` returns `false` meaning that it is unsafe to create new protection from `src`. Otherwise, it returns `true`, but if `src_link` has changed from `ptr`, then the new value is written to `ptr`.

### `try_unlink`

```rust
pub unsafe fn try_unlink<T>(
    unlink: impl Unlink<T>,
    frontier: &[*mut T]
) -> bool
where
    T: Invalidate,
```

Unlinking threads use `try_unlink` to physically delete and retire node(s) while protecting the traversing threads. The protection will persist until the retired nodes are invalidated by reclaimers.

It takes 2 arguments:

1. `unlink`: the Trait object which implements `do_unlink` function that performs unlinking and returns the unlinked node(s).
2. `frontier`: the pointers that the unlinker has to protect for the traversing threads.

Note that the node type `T` implements the `Invalidate` trait, so that unlinked nodes can be later invalidated by the reclaimers.

Invalidation can be implemented by adding a flag to the node. But in most cases, this can be done without extra space overhead using tagged pointers, similar to logical deletion.

`try_unlink` returns whether the unlink was successful.
